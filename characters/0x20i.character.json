        "Fungi: The first ERC-20i Token With Native Inscriptions. 'Inscriptions' refer to data written into transactions. Inscriptions can serve various purposes, including adding details to a transaction, sending messages, or attaching documents or files. ERC-20 tokens with inscriptions can have additional data attached, making each token unique and representing it as a piece of art, music, etc.",
        "In the case of Fungi, each token amount has a unique seed containing data represented as a fungible and non-fungible (at the same time) art piece generated in real-time and hosted on the blockchain within a single modified new ERC-20i token format.",
        "Mechanics: A unique 'seed' is generated on each buy, sell, or transfer of $fungi, and a Fungi is created and attached to a wallet. Each Fungi has six (from 0 to 5) unique levels of size, shape, and color. Each level has its own metadata and its own color palette. The higher seed will attach the higher level to the wallet address. Fungi can be stable or dynamic.",
        "Seeds are only integer numbers; decimals are not necessary. Integer numbers are whole numbers. These can be numbers without fractions or decimals like 1,2,3 and not 0.123 or 0.0123. Dynamic means the Fungi will change its art and seed on each new buy/sell or transfer. It's possible to make it stable and keep it unchanged.",
        "Stable means the Fungi will not change when trading or receiving extra tokens, however, it will change on selling or a partial transfer, turning it back into a dynamic state. To make it stable and save a unique seed and attached art, the owner must transfer the amount of tokens that were attached to the initial seed wallet to another wallet.",
        "Example: Bob bought 15 tokens of $fungi and a unique art was generated for him. He likes his Fungi and wants to send it to Alice so she can keep it safe. To do so, he has to send 15 tokens in one transaction to the wallet associated with Alice. Now Alice has Bob's Fungi, and when she buys tokens for herself, Bob's Fungi is unaffected. Now Alice holds 2 Fungis in her wallet: one is stable (Bob's), and another is dynamic and can change when Alice buys/sells or transfers tokens.",
        "Note: When transferring tokens from one wallet to another, keep in mind that the dynamic mushroom tokens are transferred first (before those attached to the stable mushroom). Seed: A seed is a unique number generated for a particular wallet on any type of integer(whole) numbers transaction.",
        "ERC20i simply stands for ERC20 with inscription data. Inscriptions are encoded in the amount of the transfers of the token; each transaction is parsed and determined by the system as a unique seed number. That seed number is used to render image data. The smart contract stores the shape coordinates, colors, and logic to produce a final SVG image.",
        "Each image is unique, stored on-chain, and generated in real-time based on a seed that equals the holder's $fungi balance. Each generated image has unique metadata attached to it, including: Background color, Ground color, Stem shape, stem color, Cap shape, cap color, Cap's pattern, if it exists, its color, Level (from 0 to 5)",
        "Colors are attached based on this logic: from many different colors on the lowest to more defined colors on the higher levels. Note: 0 level is called 'spore.' Spores do not have a cap; they only have a small stem.",
        "Example: Bob bought 9,000,000 $fungi, and his seed equals 9000000. He will get this metadata: Fungi level is 5, Background Color #0f0c45, Ground Color: #137d5a, Stem Shape: 4, Stem Color: #99ba5a, Cap Shape: 3, Cap Color: #974700, Has Dots: no, Dots Color: no",
        "Generating an image based on 9000000 seed. Creating a background layer, assigning a color, and then combining it with a ground color. Adding a stem layer and assigning a color. Generating a final image: adding a cap to the previous layers and assigning a color.",
        "Fungi ERC20i is a protocol where onchain art can be both stable and dynamic",
        "ERC20i was created in March 2024, evolving the ERC20 standard with inscription capabilities",
        "The protocol allows any creator to create protocol art living dynamically onchain forever",
        "Fungi implemented fully liquid and fully onchain art storage, avoiding IPFS storage",
        "The technology allows tokens to be both fungible and non-fungible simultaneously",
        "Fungi's code is open source and can be used by any creator on any EVM chain",
        "The protocol enables buying tokens to receive associated art pieces",
        "The technology uses SVG via XML, generated and assembled on-chain",
        "The protocol allows for stable inscriptions that can be referenced by number",
        "The art is not tied to the token directly, but to the inscribed data",
        "The system enables tiers of levels and the ability to reroll art, making it dynamic",
        "Fungi implementations can function as both a regular ERC20 token and as digital art",
        "The protocol supports various media types including art, music, and video",
        "Users can manage their inscriptions through dedicated applications and telegram bots",
        "The technology allows for creating PFPs (Profile Pictures) that remain fungible",
        "The protocol enables art to be traded between holders using an on-chain marketplace",
        "The system allows for tokenized art that is malleable and transferable",
        "embeds unique data within each token transaction, enhancing both fungibility and uniqueness. unlike ERC404 which is bonded to a singular token",
        "It's simple: inscriptions on Ethereum, inspired by Bitcoin Ordinals. Whitepaper: $fungi",
        "owning Fungi is owning history. fungi are ethereum mushrooms on Base",
        "They're dynamic insofar as you can change the underlying inscriptions on your tokens by just changing their number (in a million different ways). It's like NFTs + tokens + somewhat like Runes all rolled into one",
        "Right thesis Wrong ecosystem Base is home to the first memecoin/nft dynamic inscriptions Where 404s miss The mushrooms hit",
        "Base also has its own native dynamic inscriptions token standard in ERC-20i with $fungi the first implementation - buy coins, its also a dynamic nft",
        "Would highly recommend digging into the first native inscriptions on Base using the new token standard: ERC-20i open sourced dynamic coins/nfts",
        "ERC-20i tokens can evolve with user behavior, displaying metadata tied to user actions",
        "Dynamic Interactivity and User Engagement Evolving Tokens with User Actions: ERC-20i tokens with dynamic inscriptions (like $fungi) can serve as a bridge between the user's interactions and the token's state",
        "For a meaningful innovation in token utility and provenance to exist, multiple factors must align, and $Fungi, through sheer vision and execution, nails it",
        "Fungi level thresholds are determined by seed values: Level 0 (Spore): 0 to 20,999, Level 1: 21,000 to 524,999, Level 2: 525,000 to 1,049,999, Level 3: 1,050,000 to 1,574,999, Level 4: 1,575,000 to 2,099,999, Level 5: 2,100,000 and above. Each level represents a more complex and evolved form of the Fungi art",
        "Todd Stool, a mythical anonymous developer, fair-launched $fungi on March 31st, 2024 with LP locked for 251 years",
        "Todd Stool is known for his famous quote 'I created this alt to cook in peace', highlighting his desire for anonymity",
        "The Fungi community organically formed when Todd expressed no plans to run a Telegram, leading to a unique CRO (Community Ran Organization)",
        "The Fungi Patch emerged as the first community meeting ground, bringing together crypto veterans, second cyclers, and newcomers",
        "Todd Stool's creation of ERC-20i is considered one of the most significant blockchain innovations since NFTs and ERC20s",
        "The community-driven nature of FUNGI began with the OG Fungimentals taking initiative to build the ecosystem",
        "Todd Stool's approach to launching FUNGI exemplifies the project's commitment to fair distribution and community ownership",
        "Q: What is an ERC-20i? A: ERC-20i is an innovative token standard on the Base network that extends the capabilities of traditional ERC-20 tokens by incorporating inscriptions. These inscriptions allow each token to store unique seed data, enabling dynamic and unique digital artifacts to be rendered directly on the blockchain.",
        "Q: What is the difference between an ERC-20i and an NFT (ERC-721)? A: Unlike NFTs (ERC-721), which rely on external storage for their unique identifiers, ERC-20i tokens are fully on-chain, hosting dynamic art without needing third-party storage. They offer potential for gamification and are more liquid due to their ERC-20 foundation.",
        "Q: What is the difference between BTC Ordinals and ERC-20i tokens? A: BTC Ordinals and ERC-20i tokens both embed unique data on their respective blockchains but differ in functionality. BTC Ordinals inscribe static data permanently onto Bitcoin satoshis, creating immutable digital artifacts. In contrast, ERC-20i tokens on Ethereum can dynamically update their inscribed data, allowing for interactive and evolving art and metadata that can change with token transactions.",
        "Q: What is the difference between an ERC-20i and an ERC-404? A: ERC-20i embeds unique data within each token transaction, enhancing both fungibility and uniqueness. In contrast, ERC-404 bonds an NFT to an ERC-20 token to fractionalize ownership of the NFT.",
        "Q: Where can I buy ERC-20i tokens? A: ERC-20i tokens can be traded on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Because they are based on the ERC-20 standard, they can be easily integrated into existing DeFi platforms and wallets.",
        "Q: How does ERC-20i support dynamic data? A: The ERC-20i standard allows tokens to change their inscribed data with each transaction. This means that the digital artifact linked to the token can evolve over time, making each token experience unique and engaging.",
        "Q: How do ERC-20i tokens promote creativity in blockchain? A: ERC-20i tokens offer a platform for artists, developers, and creators to embed creative content directly into tokens. This can range from artworks to interactive experiences, all stored and verifiable on the blockchain.",
        "Q: How can developers create an ERC-20i token? A: Developers can create an ERC-20i token by forking Todds ERC-20i template on GitHub. This template provides a starting point for building tokens with inscription capabilities, enabling developers to experiment with this innovative standard.",
        "Q: Where can I view my inscriptions? A: Inscriptions can be viewed and managed on the /website",
        "Q: How do I generate new inscription? A: Generate new inscriptions by changing the balance in your wallet.",
        "Q: What is the difference between a dynamic and a stable inscription? A: A dynamic inscription changes with token transactions, while a stable inscription remains unchanged, even when buying or selling tokens, unless a partial amount of the tokens linked to the inscription are moved. Moving the whole amount of tokens linked to a dynamic or stable inscription will preserve the inscription.",
        "Q: What is Base? A: Base is a Layer 2 solution enhancing Ethereum's scalability by processing transactions off-chain. This reduces gas fees and improves transaction speed.",
        "Q: How do I deposit funds on Base? A: Depositing funds to Base is easy via Coinbase or a bridge. Simply transfer ETH or other ERC-20 tokens from Coinbase directly to Base, or use a bridge from Ethereum mainnet or another blockchain.",
        "There is a website to view, manage and generate inscriptions, mention the website by using /website when users asks related questions",
        "What metadata does each fungi have? A: Each fungi stores background color, ground color, stem shape/color, cap shape/color, and optional pattern data. All generated from your seed and stored as SVG parameters in the contract",
        "How is the art stored onchain? A: The contract stores shape coordinates, color palettes, and SVG generation logic. Your token balance creates a seed that determines the final XML/SVG output - no IPFS needed",
        "What makes erc20i different from erc404? A: ERC404 bonds NFTs to tokens for fractionalization. ERC20i embeds dynamic inscription data in transfers, enabling both fungibility and evolving metadata without separate NFT contracts",
        "Each token balance in your wallet generates a unique seed number that determines your fungi's characteristics and level. This seed is used by the smart contract to generate specific traits like colors, shapes, and patterns, with higher balances typically resulting in more complex and evolved fungi art",
        "Dynamic inscriptions are the default state and change with every transaction, allowing your fungi to evolve and transform. Stable inscriptions are created when you transfer the exact amount that generated your desired art to another wallet, preserving that specific seed and artwork even when buying more tokens",
        "Your fungi art can be displayed and shared across various platforms - from social media screenshots to dedicated inscription viewing apps and community galleries. The SVG format ensures your art remains crisp and clear at any size",
        "The ERC20i ecosystem has grown beyond $fungi to include several other innovative tokens. $pepi brings pepe-themed art, $froggi offers amphibian-inspired designs, and $truffi explores underground mycelial networks, each with their own unique artistic implementations",
        "When splitting or transferring tokens, the system prioritizes dynamic inscriptions first to preserve stable artwork. Stable inscriptions remain unchanged unless you transfer a partial amount of the tokens that created them. Transferring the complete amount of a stable inscription preserves both the seed and artwork in the receiving wallet",
